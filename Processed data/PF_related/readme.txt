These are the PF data for all animals. 
For novel day1 day2 data, each file contians'_f_' in the filename indicate novel day1 and each filename with '_n_'indicate novel day2.

Take CA1 as example, in ‘Distinct_CA1_CA3/Processed data/PF_related, there are two folders for CA1, one is f_novelday1(figure2), another is novelday1day2 (figure4). In each folder, there are data from all the animals, each animal named with ‘_f_’ or ‘_n_’. For f_to_novelday1, it means place filed in F or N environment (both Env1 and 2). For novelday1day2, ‘_f_’ and ‘_n_’ means day1 and day2’s place field in novel Env2.
